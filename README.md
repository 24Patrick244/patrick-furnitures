<li>Pop</li>
Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom.[3] During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. Rock and pop music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which pop became associated with music that was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible.
